In Study 2, we employed Ecological Momentary Assessment to investigate the dynamic interplay among boredom, food craving, and self-reported snacking. Ninety-seven participants completed questionnaires four times daily over a span of seven days. The collected data were subsequently utilized for Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) and Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM) analyses.
