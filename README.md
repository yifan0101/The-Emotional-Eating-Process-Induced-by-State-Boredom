## Abstract:
Boredom is a commonly experienced negative emotional state in people's lives. Evidence suggests that boredom can trigger emotional eating, but the process differs from the emotional eating observed during other negative emotions. In this study, using general negative emotions and neutral emotions as controls, emotional eating is divided into two stages: eating intention and eating behavior. The aim is to explore how activity-induced emotions influence the process of emotional eating intention and behavior. The study also introduces a temporal dimension to investigate predictive relationships between emotions, intentions, and behaviors across different stages. Analytical methods such as mixed linear models and autoregressive cross-lagged models are employed. The results indicate that under feelings of boredom, participants showed increased consumption of potato chips and heightened eating intentions. Furthermore, the relationship between eating intentions and eating behaviors can be influenced by grouping.
